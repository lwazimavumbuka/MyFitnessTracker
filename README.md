# My Fitness Tracker

This is a personal project that I have started working on to help me achieve my fitness goals. My Fitness Tracker is a web application that helps me track my workouts and meals. In the app I will be able to journal and keep track of which exercise, weight and number of reps I have completed on that day.

The web application also has a feature to track my meals. This feature allows me to add my meals for the day and calculates the macros and nutrition in each meal. I will also be able to add the food that I eat and they nutritional facts per 100g of serving. This will help the app to calculate the amount of calories are in each meal.

In the app, I will also be able to specify my current weight and height to get a rough estimate of how many calories I need to eat to be on a surplus or deficit. The app will also feature insights and graphs to show how far I am to reaching my goals.
